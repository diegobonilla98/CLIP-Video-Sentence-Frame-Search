# CLIP-Video-Sentence-Frame-Search
Search anything in a video using openAI's model CLIP.


I was just playing with CLIP because no life and I wondered if the model could be used in video-vigilance to search for a concept. I used the zero-shot power of the model and when a +- arbitray threshold of text-image symilarity is reached, the frame is close enough to the concept.
